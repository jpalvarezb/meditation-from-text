MEDITATION_TECHNIQUES = {
    "mindfulness": "guide the listener through gentle, non-judgmental awareness of breath, body, and present-moment sensations. use a calm, observational tone. encourage acceptance of thoughts and feelings exactly as they are.",
    "visualization": "use vivid, symbolic imagery to guide the listener through a metaphorical landscape that mirrors their emotional state. let the imagery unfold organically, supporting transformation through metaphor.",
    "breathing": "center the meditation on the breath. offer slow, structured breathing cues (e.g., box breathing, deep belly breaths). keep language rhythmic and minimal, syncing with the natural cadence of breath.",
    "affirmations": "repeat supportive, emotionally attuned affirmations. promote self-love, resilience, and inner strength. keep phrasing simple, intentional, and calming.",
